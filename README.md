# ADMute-Ad-Blocker
A minimalistic Ad blocker Chrome Extension

I created a Simple Ad Blocker Chrome extension forÂ improving user surfing experiences. By effectively combating invasive advertisements, this plugin offers users a smooth and uninterrupted internet experience.

I built a simple design with a user-friendly interface using the capabilities of the Chrome extension framework. The manifest.json file, where I made use of declarativeNetRequest, is where the core of the extension is found. This made it possible to screen and prevent advertising effectively without affecting surfing speed.

I created a rules.json file with a set of carefully selected criteria to recognize and ban particular URLs connected to ads in order to simplify the filtering process. For instance, by successfully blocking websites like doubleclick.net and googleadservices.com, annoying advertisements on websites were significantly reduced.
